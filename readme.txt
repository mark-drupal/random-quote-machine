This Forms part of the freecodecamp tutorials on front end libaries.  The tutorials at freecodecamp can be found here:

As a part of the tutorials I learnt about Bootstrap, JQuery, Sass, React, and Redux.  

The random quote machine was a task that I was set to complete.  You can view a solution of what it should look like in order to pass

I decided initially instead of forking the codepen.io test, that I would gain more out of coding myself on my local enviroment.
